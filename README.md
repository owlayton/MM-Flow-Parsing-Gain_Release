# MM-Flow-Parsing-Gain_Release

Mathematical model that estimates combinations of self-motion and depth gain factors that are most consistent with human judgments of   object motion during self-motion. Self-motion gain refers to the proportion of observer self-motion factored out of object's optical motion (1 = fully factored out). Depth gain refers to the accuracy with which the depth of the object was perceived (1 means depth correctly perceived, <1 means underestimation, >1 means overestimation). Considers non-uniform Bayesian priors based on existing psychophysical research.

See Layton, Parade, & Fajen (Frontiers in Psychology) for mathematical details.
